# Module Eight Journal

## How do I approach designing software?
### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
##### New design skills my work toward completing project two helped me craft the ability to understand lighting and the effects of its angle toward the scene. Studying light within the OpenGL environment also educated me about ambient, specular, and diffuse lighting and the effects of them onto objects within a 3D scene. I have also crafted the ability to mentally visualize how much an object/shape has to be scaled, rotated, and translated within the environment to obtain the desired outcome with reduced rework on code.
### What design process did you follow for your project work?
##### The design process I followed was by visualizing the 3D scene, either through describing it on paper or by taking a photograph for immitation. Then, I would form the objects within the scene using the primitive shapes provided within the OpenGL API. I would then apply textures downloaded from a non-copyright source and apply it to the object of my choosing. Applying appropriate lighting onto the scene the next step in the process – tweaking ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting with varying intensities. Finally, I would apply the material shader onto the objects of the scene for desired reaction or reflectivity from the light sources. All that there is left to do now is by making necessary adjustments to the scene for an optimal "look" of the scene.
### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
##### Tactics from my design approach can be applied towards future work in a similar way if I were to be working with an API like OpenGL, or other frameworks such as Vuklan or Metal. The same tactics as described can be used when rendering objects of both 2D and 3D games.


## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
##### New development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene was realizing that many of the repeatable object creations (i.e. creating 5 tori to form a coffee mug) can be implemented into a for-loop for cleaner and refactorable code within the C++ environment.
### How did iteration factor into your development?
##### I simply hard-coded all the primitive shapes into the SceneManager, so I was not able to implement for-loops and compact functions for code refactoring as intended. However, towards the end of the module I realized how the implementation of abstraction was important in creating a coding environment that is both scalable and maintainable; however, due to time constraints I performed what worked best for the project requirements at the time.
### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
##### My approach to developing code has evolved throughout the milestones through mental graphical visualization and emphasizing the importance of applying the abstraction concept for most, if not all object within a 3D scene.


## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
##### The principles of graphics and visualizations that I have learned in this course can be applied to future education pathways such as real-life product engineering and design when using other design softwares such as AutoCAD or MatLAB since many of these engineering software tools utilize linear algebra, matrices and coordinate systems as does OpenGL.
##### Overall, this course has taught me the general process of how 3D graphics begins and ends with a finished product. The principles learned in this course is similar to how software and UI/UX design is approached.
